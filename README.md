# Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment Load Tester 
Our capstone project is about building an Electrical Vehicle Supply Equipment Load Tester to help technician to observe the charging station issues like current overloading cause the inefficient charging.  However, due to the pandemic, we cannot access the school lab, so we only completed and tested the development of the pilot circuit, communication with a Bluetooth Low Energy microcontroller to google chrome and the development of a website that has a user interface and created a database to record data received from the microcontroller.
